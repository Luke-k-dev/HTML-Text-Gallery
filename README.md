# HTML-Text-Gallery
A better version of the w3schools text gallery. Complete with animations, mobile support, and better compatibility with outdated browsers. This version is designed for use with the SquareSpace platform. To use on another hosting set up, please replace the next::before and previous::before content values with a unicode option supported by the font you would like to use.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>On SquareSpace</h3>
Simply click add code block and cut and paste the code in. Then change the quotes and authors to the desired values, to not use quotes remove the quote::before and quote::after css and leave the author tag empty. 

<h3>Every Where Else</h3>
Change the CSS fonts and the next and previous sudo elements to the desired fonts and change the content of those to the desired unicode characters or text. To not use quotes follow the same practice you would if you were using SquareSpace.
